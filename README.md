# QuantStream
# Real-time Market Data Pipeline

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a high-performance, scalable real-time market data processing pipeline. The goal is to create a system capable of ingesting high-frequency market data streams, processing them using a microservices architecture, and performing real-time risk calculations, trading signals generation, or order execution algorithms.

Once completed, this pipeline will leverage Apache Kafka for data ingestion and streaming, deploy microservices on Kubernetes for flexible and scalable processing, and utilize advanced stream processing techniques. The project intends to provide financial institutions and trading firms with a robust infrastructure for handling large volumes of market data in real-time, enabling them to make informed decisions quickly and efficiently.

## Planned Technology Stack

- Apache Kafka: Data ingestion and streaming
- Kubernetes: Container orchestration and deployment
- Docker: Containerization of microservices
- Kafka Streams / KSQL: Stream processing
- Time-series Database (InfluxDB / TimescaleDB): Data storage
- Prometheus & Grafana: Monitoring
- ELK Stack: Logging
- Jaeger / Zipkin: Distributed tracing

## Proposed System Architecture

1. Data Ingestion: Kafka-based ingestion service
2. Processing Microservices: To be deployed on Kubernetes
3. Stream Processing: Kafka Streams / KSQL jobs
4. Data Storage: Time-series database
5. API and Visualization: RESTful API and web dashboard
6. Monitoring and Logging: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack, and distributed tracing

## Current Status

This project is currently in the planning and initial development phase. The README and documentation will be updated as the project progresses and components are implemented.
